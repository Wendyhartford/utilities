Google several different ways.  Google descriptions to get proper terms.  Explore not-quite-right results to see if it narrows down the search.

Stay on the first page of results.

Look at official docs for more generic answers.  Elsewhere for specific examples that may or may not be useful.

Look at every website, even ones that aren't stack overflow, but pay attention to:
Date of publication since code changes
How many positive comments/reviews it has
What those comments say since oftentimes the comments are just as helpful as the page itself
